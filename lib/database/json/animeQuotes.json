To be honest, part of me regrets that we met, but if I were to choose between a life in which we met and a life in which we didn\u2019t, I would always pick the former. Always. I\u2019m sure of that, even though I may be hesitating over, wavering about, and regretting my choices all the time.

The things reflected in my eyes have no meaning. The things that could not be reflected in my eyes do not exist. Walking walking walking walking walking walking walking walking. When I had arrived at last. I have found something extraordinary. It was somewhat the place of birth for those strange translucent objects that dotted this world. It was the first time... my eyes have been captured. With no colour, with no sound, with no scent. Does not interact with anything, it only exists there. It was the closest existence to \"void\" that I had ever laid eyes on. I sank my body... into... that great \"void\". There was nothing there,... Even I had lost my line of vision, and dissolved into the void... And felt as if everything had disappeared. Happiness. If such a thing called happiness exists in this world, it should be something which resembles the limitless nothingness. Nihility is having nothing, and having nothing to lose.

However, being blissfully unaware of this, relying on whatever someone provided without thinking, and only seeing things as \"black\" or \"white\" with such overly simplified thinking... Isn't that a sin as well? People need to think for themselves. For this reason, someone \"grey\", someone between \"black\" and \"white\" is essential. I will not gloss over the flaws in my ideals. It's not possible for all of mankind to share the same kind of thoughts. However, everyone is capable of thought. Everyone can learn, share, and decide with their own strength. A world built upon an understanding of that. If this is a \"dream\", if I don't realize it, who will?",

Although we can\u2019t fly through the skies all alone, if we can think it, we can do almost anything. We can sleep when we\u2019re sleepy. We are free to start or stop anything whenever we wish. Of course, it is a bit hindered by common sense, moralities, and the rules of society. Walking nude out in the streets, stealing from the elderly, and even killing, we can do all of this as long as we throw out our morals. Which is why they drill these laws in our head when we are children. And yet, people still continue to fight, deceive, and steal from each other. And so, people suffer because they live. Even now, there are events of happiness and unhappiness going on all over the world. \u2026What can we do to make everyone happy? Of course that\u2019s impossible for me to know. If the answer to that could be found in the shallow wisdoms of a kid, wars would have stopped long ago. But I also dislike just leaving that problem up to society or the government. After all, a great person is just one who follows the popular will of the people. In this world, the essence of a frank honest human is just an idealization. I\u2019m sure that there\u2019s nothing that can make everyone happy. Happiness is relative, and that\u2019s how people want it. Evil is also relative. Mothers can become demons when they do anything to protect their child. Yet it\u2019s usually seen as admirable. But when a person does anything for the country he loves, wars break out. Isn't it all the same thing? No matter how much a person pretends to be good and kind, he will still have negative aspects. But nobody really tries to notice that fact. Why is that? They all try to place the blame on others, and never even consider the possibility that they themselves may have played part in the problem. Just what the heck am I thinking? The world isn't going to change no matter what I think. Then what should I be doing? I don\u2019t really want to do anything. I don\u2019t want to order nor trouble anyone. That\u2019s just laziness, I guess. I don\u2019t go to school nor do I work and I've been wasting my time away since noon. Look at me, talking about the freedom of humans when I\u2019m just some suspicious punk in this town. In conclusion, I have nothing.",

The one on your left side? Or the one on your right side? Usually you would take the one on your left side. That is \u2018correct\u2019 too. But in a larger sense on society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute \u2018society\u2019 with the \u2018Universe\u2019. The correct answer is that \u2018It is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first.\u2019 \u2026Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there\u2019s no choice but for others to also take the \u2018right\u2019 napkin. The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. This is \u2018society\u2019\u2026 Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations? Who was the first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a Republic? Or was it Arbitrary? NO! The one who took the napkin first determined all of these things! The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of \u2018right or left?\u2019! In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow! In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle. And the one who \u2018takes the napkin first\u2019 must be someone who is respected by all. It\u2019s not that anyone can fulfill this role\u2026 Those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. And those are the \u2018losers\u2019. In the case of this table, the \u2018eldest\u2019 or the \u2018Master of the party\u2019 will take the napkin first\u2026 Because everyone \u2018respects\u2019 those individuals.\n",
